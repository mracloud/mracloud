# Hi, I'm Alper aka @mr_acloud

Just another bearded human being, lifelong learner, and tech enthusiast living and working in Hamburg, Germany. I’m just trying to navigate myself thru this thing called life!

- I'm interested in bringing old or ancient hardware back to life with Linux (Debian, Elementary OS and Zorin OS).
- I’m currently learning CSS and WordPress.
