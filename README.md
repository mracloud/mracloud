# Hi, I'm Alper aka @mr_acloud

Just another bearded human being, lifelong learner, and tech enthusiast living and working in Hamburg, Germany. I’m just trying to navigate myself thru this thing called life!

- 👀 I’m interested in Linux (Debian, Elementary OS and Zorin OS).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning WordPress.
